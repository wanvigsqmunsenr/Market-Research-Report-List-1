<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Developer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type</li><li>Negative Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist developer market is primarily divided into positive and negative types. Positive photoresist developers dissolve the exposed regions of a photosensitive film, allowing the underlying substrate to be patterned. They are preferred for high-resolution applications, making them popular in semiconductor manufacturing. In contrast, negative photoresist developers harden upon exposure to light, leaving behind unexposed areas after development. This type is often used for thick films and specific applications where better resolution on microstructures is required. Each type serves distinct needs in the electronics and photolithography industries.</p></p>
